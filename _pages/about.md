Hola!, my name is Paulo Montero-Camacho. I am originally from Costa Rica. I recently received my PhD in Physics from The Ohio State University. My work lies in the interception between theoretical and computational cosmology.  Most of my work consists on exploring non-Standard probes of cosmology and astrophysics, i.e. exploring new exciting ideas and their ripples in our observations and theories.  

Current research interests (and advisor)
======
My current research interests focus in cosmology, notably early universe and non-standard probes of cosmology. In particular, I am interested in 21 cm cosmology, CMB polarization, cosmic reionization, intensity mapping, primordial black holes, WFRIST, and instabilities in mergers of neutron stars. My advisor is [Prof. Christopher Hirata](https://hirata10.github.io/), he is an active member of the [Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics](https://ccapp.osu.edu/). Recently, I have been working in CMB circular polarization, binary neutron star mergers, primordial black holes constraints, exoplanets and the effects of reionization in the Lyman-alpha forest.


Brief educational bio
------
I went to the Scientific High School of Alajuela, this is where my interest in physics really grew thanks to my great teacher Pablo Blanco. 

I did my undergraduate in physics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). I graduated with honors and top of my class in 2013. My undergraduate research focused on General Relativity, principally the exploration of new approximate and exact solutions of Einstein's field equations. I worked with [Prof. Francisco Frutos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v266pX8AAAAJ&hl) and [Prof. Javier Bonatti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier_Bonatti-Gonzalez).

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
