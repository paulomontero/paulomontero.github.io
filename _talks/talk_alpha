I will give a brief overview of my research in the field of cosmology. In particular, I will talk very briefly about my research in Primordial Black Holes as dark matter candidates. Furthermore, I will talk about mu current research program on the thermal fossils from hydrogen reionization, and how their ripples from 12.8 billion years ago can help us learn more about how the Universe transitions from mainly neutral to highly ionized. In addition, I will mention the interesting open questions that require further investigation.
